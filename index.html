            <h3>Chicken</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Roast chicken is chicken prepared as food by roasting whether in a home kitchen, over a fire, or with a professional rotisserie (rotary spit). Generally, the chicken is roasted with its own fat and juices by circulating the meat during roasting, and therefore, are usually cooked exposed to fire or heat with some type of rotary grill so that the circulation of these fats and juices is as efficient as possible. Roast chicken is a dish that appears in a wide variety of cuisines worldwide.

          Beef bourguignon is a well-known, traditional French recipe. The dish originates from the Burgundy region which is in the east of present-day France, as do many other dishes such as coq au vin, escargot, persillé ham, oeufs en meurette, gougères, pain d'épices, etc. It is a stew prepared with beef braised in red wine, traditionally red Burgundy, and beef broth, generally flavoured with garlic, onions and a bouquet garni, with pearl onions and mushrooms added towards the end of cooking.

        <h3>Sushi</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨) is the Japanese preparation and serving of specially prepared vinegared rice combined with varied ingredients such as chiefly seafood vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the key ingredient is sushi rice, also referred to as shari, or sumeshi. Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients, and many others are vegetarian.
